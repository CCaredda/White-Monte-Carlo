# 0: Nominal values for all compartments
# 1: functional activity in GM only (HbO2 +5µM, Hb -3.75µM, Cyt +0.5µM ox, -0.5µM red)
# 2: same functional activity in GM and blood vessel
# 3: functional activity in GM and larger change in blood vessel (+25µM HbO2, -2.5µM Hb, see Wide-field optical mapping of neural activity and brain haemodynamics: considerations and novel approaches)
# 4: functional activity in blood vessel only (+25µM HbO2, -2.5µM Hb)
